## About

As a passionate developer, I believe that consistent practice is the key to mastering any programming language or technology. This repository serves as a hub for my coding exercises, challenges, and personal projects. Here, you'll find a collection of code snippets, programs, and scripts that I've written while exploring TDD (Test Driven Development).

## Technologies

In this repository, you'll find code written in various programming languages and technologies, including but not limited to:

- Ruby
- Python
- JavaScript
- Flutter (Dart)
- and more!

I've heared the qoute from my advisor "You should define your own logic from frameworks", so expect this list to grow as I continue my coding journey.
